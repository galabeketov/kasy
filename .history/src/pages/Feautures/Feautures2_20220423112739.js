        What is the Purpose of Text Features? The purpose of text features is to
        help provide an understanding of how the text was written. They also
        help break the text up into chunks so it’s easier for us to read and
        understand. For example, if we were reading a chapter in a book without
        any headings, it would be very difficult to know when one section ends
        and another begins. This can be especially confusing if there are many
        paragraphs that contain long sentences or complicated words that go on
        for several lines at times. Without headings, the following chapter may
        start in the middle of one complete thought with no warning whatsoever,
        which will make it hard to understand what is being said next. Text
        features are important because they help organize texts both physically
        (into sections) and linguistically (into chunks). This makes it easier
        for the reader to pinpoint information and therefore understand the
        author’s intended message. 1. Titles Titles are headings that give us an
        idea of what the text is about before we even read it. For example, if
        there was a chapter in a book with no title except for “Chapter 6,” it
        would be difficult to know what this chapter is about or where it fits
        within the whole story. However, if there were titles at the beginning
        of every chapter such as “The Plan” followed by “Finding Allies,” then
        it would be much easier for us to organize the information into
        different sections and come up with our own understanding of how each
        section connects with one another throughout the entire work. 2. Table
        of contents A table of contents is a list at the beginning of a text
        that lists out all of the headings and subtitles within it, along with
        their corresponding page numbers. This allows readers to have an idea of
        what they will be reading about before they actually start digging into
        it. Depending on how long each section is, this can also allow them to
        skim through the entire text so they can choose which sections they want
        to read first or last. In fiction texts , titles are very important
        because they give audiences an idea of what the story entails without
        having to read through everything. Readers may decide if a book seems
        interesting by reading its title alone depending on whether or not it
        sounds like something they would want to read about.
