        What is the Purpose of Text Features? The purpose of text features is to
        help provide an understanding of how the text was written. They also
        help break the text up into chunks so it’s easier for us to read and
        understand. For example, if we were reading a chapter in a book without
        any headings, it would be very difficult to know when one section ends
        and another begins. This can be especially confusing if there are many
        paragraphs that contain long sentences or complicated words that go on
        for several lines at times. Without headings, the following chapter may
        start in the middle of one complete thought with no warning whatsoever,
        which will make it hard to understand what is being said next. Text
        features are important because they help organize texts both physically
        (into sections) and linguistically (into chunks). This makes it easier
        for the reader to pinpoint information and therefore understand the
        author’s intended message.
